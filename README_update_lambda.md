# Explanation of the Ansible Playbook: Install Lambda Stack

1. **Playbook Header**

```
- name: Install Lambda Stack on servers
  hosts: lambda
  become: true
  vars_files:
    - vault.yml
```

* Runs on hosts in the `lambda` group.
* Uses sudo privileges (`become: true`).
* Loads variables from `vault.yml`.

2. **Fix broken/half-installed packages**

```
- name: Fix broken/half-installed packages
  ansible.builtin.shell: dpkg --configure -a
```

* Fixes partially installed packages.
* Uses shell module because `dpkg` has no native Ansible module.

3. **Update system packages**

```
- name: Update system packages
  ansible.builtin.apt:
    name: "*"
    state: latest
    update_cache: yes
```

* Updates all system packages to the latest version.
* Refreshes the package cache before upgrading.

4. **Install Lambda Stack (non-interactive)**

```
- name: Install Lambda Stack (non-interactive)
  ansible.builtin.shell: |
    wget -nv -O- https://lambda.ai/install-lambda-stack.sh | I_AGREE_TO_THE_CUDNN_LICENSE=1 sh -
```

* Downloads and executes the Lambda Stack installation script.
* Automatically agrees to the cuDNN license for a non-interactive install.

**Summary:**

1. Fix broken packages.
2. Update all packages.
3. Install Lambda Stack without user interaction.
